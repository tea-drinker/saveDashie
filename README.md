# save_dashie

A silly script to maintain a small portion of /r/place as rainbow dash.

The Place.py module it depends on is available here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/62ph3u/python_rplace_module/

The URL argument is difficult to find.

Open /r/place and open your broswer's web development panel. (ctrl+shift+i on chrome).
Refresh the page and you should see a 'websocket' item. Copy that URL for this program.
