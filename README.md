# save_dashie

A silly script to maintain a small portion of /r/place as rainbow dash.

The Place.py module it depends on is available here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/62ph3u/python_rplace_module/

Create a file called user_details.py with the following lines, updated for yourself

user = "<reddit username>"
passwd = "<reddit password>"
url = "<Websocket URL from the devtools panel in your web browser>"
